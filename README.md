# Layer-fMRI Processing Pipeline #


This is a collection of code for the layer-fMRI processing pipeline.

## Tasks ##
Current Status:

- Minimal Example of FSL-based distortion correction and motion correction
<br>
<be>

Issues:
 - Check if fieldmap resulting from **preprocessing_createFieldmap** is correct
 - find a way to output a matrix in the distortion correction step **preprocessing_applyFieldmap** to use it in the one-step version **epi_motion_and_distortion_corrected** as part of a concatenated matrix that describes the distortion correction and the motion correction together. 
 

To-Do:

- **topup** using EPI data acquired with opposite phase encoding directions
- one-step transformation for distortion correction, motion correction, and field correction
- align anatomical images to preprocessed functional images in freesurfer, LayNii conversion, layer analysis

- MP2RAGE (Magnetization Prepared - RApid Gradient Echo)
	[MP-RAGE vs. MP2RAGE](https://mriquestions.com/mp-rage-v-mr2rage.html) :"The MP2RAGE sequence, by comparison, uses two Turbo-FLASH GRE readouts between each inversion pulse."
	

- T2 SPACE: [mrimaster](https://mrimaster.com/characterise-image-3d-tse/#:~:text=This%20makes%20the%20SPACE%20sequence,echo%20sequence%20used%20in%20MRI.): "SPACE (Sampling Perfection with Application optimized Contrasts using different flip-angle Evolutions) is a 3D TSE (turbo spin echo) sequence used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Itâ€™s known for providing high-resolution isotropic 3D images, which can be reformatted in any plane without loss of image quality. This makes the SPACE sequence particularly useful for imaging structures with complex anatomy or for cases where multiplanar reconstructions are needed."
